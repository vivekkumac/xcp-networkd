# XenServer's xcp-networkd fork

This is a fork of the "upstream" Xapi-project xcp-networkd repository
(http://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-networkd) and intentionally has no `master`
branch.

There are branches here that are synced to our internal "product branches" for
our released versions and LCM streams.
